# Text-to-Animation Algorithm

This project implements a text-to-animation algorithm using AI. Given an input text, the algorithm generates an animation that visually represents the meaning of the text.

## Features

- Input text preprocessing: The algorithm processes the input text to remove stop words, extract keywords, and identify the main concepts.
- Model training: The algorithm trains a deep learning model to generate animations from text input.
- Animation generation: The algorithm uses the trained model to generate animations from input text.
- Web interface: The algorithm includes a web interface for users to input text and view the generated animations.

## Getting Started

To use the algorithm, you will need to have Python 3 and several Python packages installed. Please refer to the requirements.txt file for the full list of dependencies.
